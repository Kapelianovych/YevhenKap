### Hi there, I am Yevhen Kapelianovych 👋

Glad to see you here! ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=YevhenKap.YevhenKap)

I am full-stack, self employed (🙊 simply have no job) web developer. I love programming, books and my girlfriend ☺️.
My primary profession is not engineer, but dentist. Although, I realized that last one is not a thing, that I want dedicate to.
So I started to learn stuff, that at my opinion may make life better for another people. Stuff, that help me create something new,
something useful, something better.

As a web developer, I try to think different, search for simple and comprehensive solutions. That's why my way is long, but I glad I'm here.
