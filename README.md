I am full-stack, self employed (🙊 simply have no job) web developer. I love programming, books and my girlfriend ☺️.
My primary profession is not engineer, but dentist. Although, I realized that last one is not a thing, that I want dedicate to.
So I started to learn stuff, that at my opinion may make life better for another people. Stuff, that help me create something new,
something useful, something better.

As a web developer, I try to think different, search for simple and comprehensive solutions. That's why my way is long, but I glad I'm here.

- 👨‍💻 I am currently working on something excited.
- 📖 I am reading [Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design (Robert C. Martin)](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164)
